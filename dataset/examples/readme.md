# Examples

The `examples/` folder contains sample data and scripts to easily run and test the project. These examples help demonstrate the functionality and workflow of the project without requiring full datasets.

## Contents
- **Sample Data:**
  - Small, representative subsets of the actual datasets.
  - Useful for testing and debugging without downloading or processing the full dataset.

- **Scripts:**
  - Example scripts to load, process, and visualize the data.

## Usage
1. **Data Files:**
   - Each data file corresponds to a specific dataset and includes only a small portion of the data for easy testing.

2. **Running the Examples:**
   - Open a terminal in the `examples/` folder.
   - Run the provided scripts with the sample data:
     ```bash
     python example_script.py
     ```

3. **Customization:**
   - Replace the example data with your own files for experimentation.
   - Use these scripts as templates for processing larger datasets.

## Notes
- These examples are simplified and may not cover the full functionality of the project.
- Refer to the main `README` for more detailed documentation and workflows.
